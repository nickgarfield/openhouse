This is the server that powers the Openhouse project. In the future, this repo may get merged with the primary [client repo](https://github.com/nickgarfield/openhouse-client)

# Developer Onboarding

To get started:

```bash
yarn install
yarn test
yarn start
# go to localhost:3000
```

For this setup to work, you'll also need a backend server running (see [repo](https://github.com/nickgarfield/openhouse-server))
